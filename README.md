# What is JavaScript?

> JavaScript is a super important scripting language used to add animated and interactive features to websites or web applications (on top of the basic, static structures created   by languages like HTML and CSS).

### Features!

- JavaScript (or JS) is a scripting language used to create and control dynamic web content.
- Dynamic web content includes things like animated graphics, photo slideshows, and interactive forms.
- Anytime you visit a website where things move, refresh, or otherwise change on your screen without requiring you to manually reload a web page, there’s a very good chance JS is the language making it happen.

# What is a JavaScript Library?

> JavaScript libraries are collections of pre-written JavaScript code that can be used for common JS tasks, allowing you to bypass the time intensive (and unnecessary) process of coding by hand. Ex: JQuery,React

# What is React JS?

REACT JS is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. It is widely used as a base in building single-page websites and mobile applications. It is very easy to use, and it allows users to create reusable UI components.

> React is a JavaScript “library”. It is not exactly a “framework”. It is not a complete solution and you will often need to use more libraries with React to form any solution. React does not assume anything about the other parts in any solution


# Why React JS?

The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in the application. This corresponds to the view in the MVC template. It can be used with a combination of other JavaScript libraries or frameworks, such as Angular JS in MVC.

1. Simplicity
 
   > ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This is not a requirement; Developer can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.
 
2. Easy to learn
 
   > Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as ‘Domain-specific Language’, implying that it is difficult to learn them. To react, you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.
 
3. Native Approach
 
   > React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time, we can make IOS, Android and Web applications.
 
4. Data Binding
 
   > React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls the flow of data to components through one control point – the dispatcher. It's easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.
 
5. Performance
 
   > React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. You can use Browserify, Require JS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel, ReactJS-di to inject dependencies automatically.
 
6. Testability
 
   > ReactJS applications are super easy to test. React views can be treated as functions of the state, so we can manipulate with the state we pass to the ReactJS view and take a look at the output and triggered actions, events, functions, etc.

  ### JSX : 
   JSX is an extension to javascript. Though it is not mandatory to use JSX in react, it is one of the good features and easy to use.
    #### Key points about JSX
      - In JSX we can write XML like code for elements and components.
      - JSX tags have tag name, attributes and childern.
      - JSX not necessity to write React applications.
      - JSX makes your react code simpler and elegant.
      - JSX ultimately transpiles to pure JavaScript which is understood by the browsers.
      

  #### Components: 
   Components are like pure javascript functions that help make the code easy by splitting the logic into reusable independent code. We can use components as functions and components as classes. Components also have a state, props which makes life easy. Inside a class, the state of each of the props is maintained.

  #### Virtual DOM: 
   React creates a virtual dom, i.e., in-memory data-structure cache. Only the final changes of DOM has later updated in the browsers DOM.

 #### Javascript Expressions: 
   JS expressions can be used in the jsx files using curly brackets, for example {}.
